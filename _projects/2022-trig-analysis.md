My contribution to this Fluid Mechanical Dissecction was:
-helping take apart the lawn mower where I used wrenches and power tools.
-Analysis of the carburetor, specifically the venturi. I showed, using fluid mechanical tools, how a venturi mixes fuel into the airflow which then goes to the piston.
-I presented my findings in the video, showing the fluid mechanical tools and models of my analysis.
